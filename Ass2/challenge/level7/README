the bug is that there is an out of bounds decrement in the code.

we use this to remove the null byte such that when ```execl("/bin/sh", "/bin/sh", "-cp", cmd, (char *) NULL);}``` is called cmd is overead into item. for this we make item equal to 33t so that when it the stirng is overread it is overread as rm player.save;l33t and we have arbitrary commands being executed.
